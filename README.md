## Intruders (Unwanted Guests)

Intruders frequently enter different sections and disrupt operations.
If left unchecked, they cause financial loss and product waste, reducing stock and leading to **missed sales opportunities**.

| Type      | Behavior |

| **Nezumi (Rats)** üê≠ | Nibble on bread, reducing available stock. |
| **Dorob≈ç (Thieves)** üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è | Steal money directly from the register. |
| **KureimƒÅ (Complainers)** üò° | Continuously demand refunds, reducing demand tempo. |

### How to Handle Intruders
- Use the `shoo` command in **Commander mode** to chase them away.
- Ignoring intruders results in **economic losses and product spoilage**.
- **Bonus:** Successfully shooing intruders can **increase customer trust**, boosting demand.
